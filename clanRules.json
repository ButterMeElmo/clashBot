This can earn elder in most situations, but will decided case-by-case.",

It starts right around the beginning of every month.\n\n-If that seems like a lot of donations, it's not too bad. Just queue up some troops to stay in your barracks behind your army and donate a time or two a day. There are frequently many requests just waiting to be filled.",

Consider who else has attacks left, and leave room for them above or below you if they stand a good chance of beating that base. If someone lower than you can take out the base you’re clearing, and they then have nothing left to attack, you’ve wasted an attack.\n\n-If your hero is above level 5 and is down for upgrading, opt out of war. Many of the high level people here have mini accounts for this reason. We don't want to take the fun out of the game, but it hurts us to have a hero missing.",

Currently, they are literally not work building, however we do expect them to rebalance them in the future.\n\n-In general, focus on your offensive upgrades first (lab, spell factory, army camps, clan castle, barracks, heroes etc) over defensive upgrades (cannon, mortar, wiz tower, etc.)",

(As in, 600 day 1 and 200 day 2 would be the same as 400 per day.)\n\n-If you have multiple accounts eligible for the clan games, each extra account should get an additional average 200 daily for the clan games. However, these points can be divided among your accounts however you like, whatever is easiest for you. (For example, as a leader with one extra eligible account, I should average 700 a day between the two accounts, split between the two however is easiest.)",

You can politely message me if you believe you've been overlooked.\n\n-Do not spam the chat. Having a conversation is fine, but we also don't want to remove active donation requests.\n\n-Unless for war or for a Clash Event, don't constantly request troops that you cannot make. Max wiz/giants/archers/hogs are great!",

I can remove you from @ troopdonators if you want out.\n\n-There is nothing wrong with asking other clan members for advice. Similarly, failing attacks does happen, but make sure to learn from it, and not just immediately close the app never to review what you did wrong. If you can’t figure it out, ask others for feedback!\n\n-Finally, this clan is a clan made great by the members in it. If you have any suggestions, criticism, or any other form of feedback, please let me know!",
