It starts right around the beginning of every month.\n\n-If that seems like a lot of donations, it's not too bad. Just queue up some troops to stay in your barracks behind your army and donate a time or two a day. There is usually 1-2 requests up in the middle of the day for you to top off!",

Tell me when you've opted back in though!)\n\n-Get your attacks in early in war.\n\n-Do NOT rush your attacks in at the end of the war (last 6 hours)\n\n-Use your attacks intelligently, consider where other people have left to attack.\n\n-Most attacks end in 3 stars.\n\n-Respond to war reminders in Discord so we know you see them.",

(As in, 300 day 1 and 100 day 2 would be the same as 200 per day.)\n\n-If you have multiple accounts eligible for the clan games, each extra account should get an additional average 200 daily for the clan games. However, these points can be divided among your accounts however you like, whatever is easiest for you. (For example, as a leader with one extra eligible account, I should average 500 a day between the two accounts, split between the two however is easiest.)",

You can politely message me if you believe you've been overlooked for a promotion or other issue.\n\n-Do not spam the chat. Having a conversation is fine, but we also don't want to remove active donation requests.\n\n-Unless for war or for a Clash Event, don't constantly request troops that you cannot make. Max wiz/giants/archers/hogs are great!",

I can remove you from @troopdonators if you want out.\n\n-There is nothing wrong with asking other clan members for advice. Similarly, failing attacks does happen, but make sure to learn from it, and not just immediately close the app never to review what you did wrong. If you canâ€™t figure it out, ask others for feedback!\n\n-Finally, this clan is a clan made great by the members in it. If you have any suggestions, criticism, or any other form of feedback, please let me know!",
