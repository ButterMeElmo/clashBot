It starts right around the beginning of every month.\n\n-If that seems like a lot of donations, it's not too bad. Just queue up some troops to stay in your barracks behind your army and donate a time or two a day. There is usually 1-2 requests up in the middle of the day for you to top off!",

Aim to have your first attack in within the first 6 hours, but definitely have it in within 12 hours.\n\n-Do NOT rush your attacks in during the last 6 hours of war. That makes it hard to plan everyone's attacks.\n\n-Use your attacks intelligently, consider where other people have left to attack.\n\n-Know your own strength and skill. Most attacks should end in 3 stars.\n\n-Ignore the base that Supercell recommends you attack. Attack above or below your rank as needed to get 3 stars.",

Similarly, failing attacks does happen, but make sure to learn from it, and not just immediately close the app never to review what you did wrong. If you canâ€™t figure it out, ask others for feedback!\n\n-Finally, this clan is a clan made great by the members in it.
